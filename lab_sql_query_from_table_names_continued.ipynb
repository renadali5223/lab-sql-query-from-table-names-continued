        "In this exercise, we tested three different prompt styles to generate SQL queries using GPT-3.5. The question was: \"What are the names of employees who studied at MIT and earned more than 80000 in the year 2022?\" The first version (old prompt) gave the model a basic description of the tables using plain language. It did okay by joining the correct tables and filtering for salaries over 80000, but it missed the year 2022 filter. This shows the model didn’t fully understand all the conditions without a structured format or examples. The second version (new prompt) followed a paper from Ohio University. It gave the model proper SQL structure using CREATE TABLE for each table and added few-shot examples of SQL queries. This helped a lot. The model gave a correct SQL query with all conditions, including the correct date filter using strftime. The third version was a small improvement to the second one. We changed the few-shot examples to include a query with a date condition. This helped the model generalize the idea better. The output was accurate again. From this experiment, we learned that few-shot examples are very useful in helping the model write better SQL. Adding CREATE TABLE structure makes it easier for the model to understand the database schema. Also, including a sample that filters by date helps the model apply that pattern in other queries. On the other hand, the old prompt without examples didn’t work well. It led to missing important parts of the question, like the year filter. In short, prompt design matters a lot when doing natural language to SQL tasks. Even small changes in prompt structure or examples can make a big difference in the final result. It’s always a good idea to try different versions and test which one gives the most reliable and accurate output."
